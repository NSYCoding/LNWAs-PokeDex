# Pokemon project

We were tasked by our school to create a website using the PokéAPI. Each team member was assigned a different character from the Pokémon universe (except Evelyn, who is a custom character). The website was designed with each character’s traits and personality in mind.

At the beginning of the project, we discussed our approach and divided responsibilities. Since we were a team of four, we each focused on one user story. Lucas suggested that we sketch our pages on paper first to visualize our ideas. Azra, Lucas, and Wilkes began working on their character pages, while Nour focused on building the home page and creating the loading animation.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, we held stand-up meetings following the Scrum methodology to share progress and discuss any issues.

For presentation day on Thursday, we made final touch-ups to ensure the website was polished and presentable.

We tracked our tasks and progress using Notion.
